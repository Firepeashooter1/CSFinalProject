 void randLine needing a ifstream& variable to get correct txt file (file)
 > variable string (lineOne)
 > variable vector that uses a string as a perimeter (lineTwo)
 > integer variable equal to zero (maxLineNum)
 > while file shifts each line of text to lineOne
 > > increase maxLineNum
 > > add the text in lineOne to lineTwo
 > use a variable to get a random number (randNum) with the max the number can be is the number stored in maxLineNum
 > print the line from lineTwo that is on the same line number as randNum
 void actNode
 > get the ActionAPI.txt file
 > send ActionAPI.txt file to randLine to get a random line from ActionAPI.txt
 void nameNode
 > get the NameAPI.txt file
 > send NameAPI.txt file to randLine to get a random line from NameAPI.txt
 int main
 > use stand time to NULL to make random functions truly random
 > write madlib and use actNode and nameNode for the blanks to automatically fill blanks
 > return 0
